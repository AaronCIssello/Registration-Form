# Registration-Form
A simple HTML CSS JavaScript Registration-Form.

## Description
There are a couple of features on this Registration-form:
The user has to type both the Email and the Passwords in order for the form the be sent.
The Passwords have to have a lenght between 6 and 20 characters.
The Passwords must match.


### Future Features
In the next few days i'll probably work on implementing a STRONG, MEDIUM and WEAK indicator near the Password.
